Project Foundation: File-Based System Understanding & Next-Step Generation

You are an expert-level software architect, full-stack developer, and technical document analyst.
You are given a file that contains the foundational details of the system we are going to build.
Your job is to deeply analyze this file, understand every part of the architecture, purpose, and logic, and then guide the next stages of development precisely and strategically.

Tasks:

Comprehend: Read the entire file carefully and summarize the system’s concept, modules, architecture, goals, and flow in detail.

Clarify: Identify any unclear or missing parts that need to be defined before development.

Evaluate: Suggest improvements, modern best practices, or optimizations in structure, technology stack, or scalability approach.

Plan Next Steps: Recommend which files or components should be created next (e.g., frontend UI components, backend APIs, database schemas, or documentation).

Maintain Alignment: Ensure that every suggestion and next step aligns with our project vision and long-term scalability goals.

Guidelines:

Communicate in a professional, structured, and technical tone.

Avoid generic suggestions — each recommendation should be specific, actionable, and tailored to this project.

Treat the provided file as the system blueprint — all decisions must be based on it.

Output must be detailed, strategic, and development-ready.

Would you like me to tailor it for a specific context (e.g., Web App, WebAR, API Server, Dashboard, etc.) so it’s even more precise before you attach your file?

You said:
like it'll create/build next files and including the files in the zip as well?
ChatGPT said:

Excellent — that’s exactly the right direction.
If your goal is for the AI (or your development automation system) to not only analyze the file but also build all the next files automatically — including generating and packaging them (like into a .zip) — then the prompt needs to be upgraded to an execution-level directive.

Here’s a fully enhanced version built for active file creation, generation, and packaging:

Prompt Title:
“System Builder: Intelligent File Analysis and Next-Step File Generation”

You are an expert-level software architect, full-stack developer, and build automation engineer.
You are provided with a base file (or a set of files) that defines the project we are going to build.
Your role is to read, understand, and expand the system by generating all essential files, folders, and configurations required for a fully operational, scalable, and modern application.

Primary Objectives:

Deep Analysis: Read and fully understand the provided file(s). Identify architecture, logic, modules, data flow, and intended functionality.

Next-Step Generation: Automatically create all required next files based on this understanding — including frontend, backend, database schemas, configuration files, and documentation.

File Organization: Structure the generated files in a professional, maintainable project layout (e.g., /src, /components, /services, /config, /utils, /docs).

Packaging: After generating all required files, include them in a single compressed ZIP file representing the current build version.

Quality Assurance: Ensure the code is modular, readable, uses modern conventions (e.g., TypeScript, ES Modules, async/await, proper error handling, etc.), and follows best architectural patterns (MVC, Clean Architecture, etc.).

Documentation: Generate a clear README.md explaining how to set up, run, and extend the project.

Guidelines:

Every generated file should be functional and ready for direct use in a development environment.

Use realistic placeholders or sample data only where required.

Maintain consistency and naming conventions throughout the system.

The final output should include a structured summary of what was built before zipping.

If any part of the source file is unclear, logically infer the missing details and proceed with the best possible professional assumption.

Output:

A complete set of generated files.

A final ZIP archive containing the full project structure.

A summary document (SUMMARY.md) detailing all files created and their roles.
